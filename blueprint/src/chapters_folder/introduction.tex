The main goal of this internship was to formalize some results of the paper
"Weil Representation associated to finite fields" by P.GÃ©rardin.
\newline

The first section of this report introduces some addenda to mathlib (or other
formulations of existing results) that are mandatory to formalize the paper.
Those results are about finite group theory, direct sums and tensor products
and monoid algebra theory.
\newline
The second section aims to add results about the induced representation by 
the center of a finite group and to provides the formula for its character.
\newline
The third section corresponds to some parts of the paper : definition
of Heisenberg's group over vector spaces,...
