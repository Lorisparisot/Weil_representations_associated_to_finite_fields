This first chapter introduces some notions that weren't formalize in
mathlib about representation theory. The main goal of this part is to build
the induced representation in a particular case and the Frobenius reciprocity
in a particular case.

    Given $G$ a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$, we have a trivial homomorphism from $H$
    to $G$ given by $h\mapsto h$.
    \begin{proof}
        \leanok
        Trivial.

    Given $\mathbb{K}$ a field, $G$ a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$, 
    we have a trivial homomorphism from $\mathbb{K}[H]$ to $\mathbb{K}[G]$.
    \begin{proof}
        \leanok
        Trivial.
