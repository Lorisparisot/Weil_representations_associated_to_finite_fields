# Formalization of Weil Representations of classic groups over finite fields 
This is the repo of the attempt of formalizing the following article <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021869377903945?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=92923c4abd234dfe"> "Weil representations associated to finite fields"</a> written by P. GÃ©rardin.
This project is being carried out in the context of the research internship of the <a href="http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/master-2-234092.kjsp"> 2nd year of Advanced Mathematics Master of the ENS Lyon</a> and supervised by Sophie Morel.
You can find the blueprint of the project (article, proofs, dependency graph, library,...) <a href="https://lorisparisot.github.io/Weil_representations_associated_to_finite_fields/"> here</a>.
